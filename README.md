StochasticClimber.py contains the class Agent and its child class StochasticAgent. This stochastic Agent must find the global maximum of a given utility landscape. Stochasticity is used to go further than the closest local maximum. The Agent's position and utility at each step are saved in CSV format.

Visualization.py loads this CSV file and offers several representations of the Agent's path using the matplotlib.pyplot module.
