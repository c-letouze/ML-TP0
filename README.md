StochasticClimber.py contains the class Agent and its child class StochasticAgent. This stochastic Agent must find the global maximum of a given utility landscape. Its position  and utility at each step is saved in CSV format.

Visualization.py loads this CSV file and offers several representations of the Agent's path using the matplotlib.pyplot module.
